The two executables are almost identical. Extracting payload embedded in Malware 3.2 follows the same steps as for Malware 3.3.

After extracting both payloads, we can compare them side by side and see that nothing in particular differs. Of course, the C2 address, encryption/decryption keys but we'll see.

### What differs
Pretty much the only relevant thing that may differ between the two payloads is the C2 server address. 
We already found out that for payload1, the C2 address is `732u3hdgfss.com`.

If we run the debugger on Payload2, we find out that payload2 C2's address is `ajhr4tgysdihfvnfgasd.com`
